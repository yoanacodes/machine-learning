# Machine Learning


This repository contains all of the assignments created for the Machine Learning class, part of the MS Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design. It contains three final projects and their respective iterations:


* **[01: Classification, natural language processing](https://github.com/yoanacodes/machine-learning/tree/main/01_Classification_NLP)** using IMDB reviews dataset, specially selected for sentiment analysis, to classify reviews as positive or negative
* **[02: Classification, image recognition](https://github.com/yoanacodes/machine-learning/tree/main/02_Classification_image_recognition)** using Flying Dollar Airport images dataset to classify images to predict if the image contains a plane
* **[03: Unsupervised Learning, clustering with K-means](https://github.com/yoanacodes/machine-learning/tree/main/03_Clustering)** using food contamination dataset to cluster incident descriptions into broader categories
